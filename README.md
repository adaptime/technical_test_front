# Adapti.me technical test

This repository contains a technical test. This test should be completed in Javascript.

### How does it work?

To submit the test, you will need to:

- **Fork** the project [adaptime / technical_test_front](https://github.com/adaptime/technical_test_front)
- Solve the problem and add your solution to the project
- Create a **Pull request** with your *full name* as the title, and send the solution files to <jobs@adapti.me>
- Add any comments in the description of **Pull request** *(optional)*

### The problem

Among the files in this project, you will find a file called `thumbnails.html`.
This file contains several thumbnails, having titles, images, prices, etc.

The goal is to create a script in Javascript, which will order the thumbnails in ascending order of their price.
*Warning:* some thumbnails are on sale, their promotional price must be taken into account and not the original price.

A clean code and the time taken to submit the solution could make the difference.
