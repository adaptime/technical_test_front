# Adapti.me technical test

This repository contains a technical test. This test should be completed in Javascript.

### How does it work?

To submit the test, you will need to:

- **Clone** the project [adaptime / technical_test_front](https://github.com/adaptime/technical_test_front)
- Solve the problem
- Send your solution files to <jobs@adapti.me>
- Don't forget to **join** all the files 

### The problem

Among the files in this project, you will find a file called `thumbnails.html`.
This file contains several thumbnails, having titles, images, prices, etc.

##### Step 1

The goal is to create a script in **Javascript (Vanilla JS)**, which will order the thumbnails in ascending order of their price.

*Warning:* some thumbnails are on sale, their promotional price must be taken into account and not the original price.

##### Step 2

Change the HTML's style, in order that the thumbnail are displayed with the same size. The design should look like a basic recommendation.

The test shouldn't take longer than an hour to complete. The step 2 doesn't have to be pixel-perfect.

A clean code and the time taken to submit the solution can make a difference.
